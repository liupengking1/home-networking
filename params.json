It takes me over two years to \r\nfinish it, since I am at the same time working in Tuxera full time. This repository is private, but you can download the latest version of my draft thesis. I aim to submit it on 20th May 2015.\r\n\r\n### Preface\r\nThis document is my master's thesis of Communications Engineering majoring in\r\nNetworking at Aalto University. All research and development of this thesis was\r\nconducted at Tuxera Inc. in Helsinki from January 2013 to June 2014. Tuxera is a\r\nhigh-tech startup that develops kernel-level file systems and multimedia solutions\r\nfor leading software, hardware and electronics companies.\r\n\r\nDuring this project I worked together with my colleagues at Tuxera, I started\r\nto work on DLNA project for the first few months during which period I learned\r\nDLNA architecture and made a research about Digital Media Server solutions.\r\nAfter that I worked on an Android project to develop a universal solution for\r\nmultimedia home networking.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the Streambels team at Tuxera, whom I worked\r\ntogether throughout the project. I would like to thank Karthik Ramakrishna, our\r\nlead developer. Every week he helped solving problems in the project,\r\nno matter the question was theoretical or technical, he always answered my\r\nquestions. As our project manager, Oscar Santolalla helped us with\r\norganizational problems we encountered and taught us to look at things from a\r\nend user perspective as well. Sakari Tanskanen, our mobile developer helped us\r\nby integrating Chromecast and FireTV support to Stremabels. Nadir Javed, our\r\nquality assurance engineer helped us with the quality management and testing of\r\npotential bugs before releasing the product to end users. Karolina Mosiadz, our\r\nPublic Relations Manager helped to listen to user's feedback every day and provide the unique\r\ninsights in improving Streambels. Hien Le, our UX designer helped us to develop\r\na very handy user interface. And special thanks to Mikko Valimaki and Szabolcs\r\nSzakacsits who lead the company and gave me the opportunity to participate in\r\nthis great project. Without them, I would not have been able to finish this\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nI thank my university supervisor Raimo Kantola, who helped me to develop a good\r\nthesis topic based on my project and helped me with initial problem description.\r\nI got great support from him with his critique and useful advice, especially\r\nduring the middle and final period, when I wrote the report.\r\n\r\nFinally, I thank everybody who supported me during my graduation work,\r\nespecially my family, friends and house-mates.\r\n","google":"UA-57685134-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
