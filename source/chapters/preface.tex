This document is my Master's thesis for \textit{Communications Engineering, majoring in
Networking} at Aalto University. All research and development of this thesis was
conducted at Tuxera Inc. in Helsinki from January 2013 to June 2014. Tuxera is a
high-tech startup that develops kernel-level file systems and multimedia solutions
for leading software, hardware and electronics companies.

During this project, I worked together with my colleagues at Tuxera, starting
to work on the DLNA project in the first few months during which time I learned
the DLNA architecture and conducted the research about Digital Media Server
solutions. After that, I worked on an Android project to develop a universal
solution for multimedia home networking.
