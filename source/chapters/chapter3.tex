%% Developing a solution for multimedia home networking chapter
%% author Liu Peng

To fulfill the need of interoperability among devices in home networking,
Tuxera Inc. started a project named Streambels(later renamed as AllConnect). The
project aims to solve the interoperability issue in multimedia home networking
by making a universal solution that can connect all available devices at home
and make them work together regardless of what protocol they use.\\
\\
Most devices at home are embedded solutions and have their own firmwares, it is
hard to update or even impossible to upgrade the software running on these
devices. On the other hand, most home network users
 are not knowledgeable enough to 
to manually set up the more advanced
 network features to achieve certain degree of device interoperability. Plus
 most of these network infrastructures are not designed to be easily
 configured. Due to these reasons, building interoperability among different
 devices through a mobile device seems to be the most straightforward solution,
 for mobile devices can serve as a very flexible and programmable portal for
 home-networking.  Other advantages of mobile devices include their great
 processing power, networking capabilities and their wide adoption and
 availability. Through the available platforms and tools, a mobile application
 could possibly be developed to control all multimedia streaming data flows and
 act as a personal access portal for home networking.\\
\\
After a year of development, our team have built up an Android application that
can be used to control and connect every known type of multimedia device at home.
Encouragingly, the number of our application users have grown to nearly one
million so far, providing a strong proof of the effectiveness of our solution.

\subsection{Architecture overview}
The system architecture is consist of three major parts: discovery, content
management and streaming.\\
\\
Discovery component is responsible for device discovery which takes advantage of
both Multicast DNS and Simple Service Discovery Protocol. As discussed in
\ref{upnp}, the UPnP service uses Simple Service Discovery Protocol for device
discovery, the application firstly send a M-Search request over UDP to the
IPv4 multicast address 239.255.255.250 and UDP port 1900. Then the application
listen to other devices' response. DIAL devices will return a response with
Application URL header, while the UPnP/DLNA devices will return a message with
a XML body, which gives detailed service URL and description URL. SSDP is used
for both DLNA discovery and DIAL discovery. Multicast DNS is developed and
implemented by Apple Inc., and there is an open source implementation on its
website.\\
\\
Content management component is responsible for organizing and
navigating multimedia contents which can be found in the home network. In our
solution, this includes both phone's local storage and DLNA digital media
servers that connected to home network. The sources can be used in all of the
three protocols that we support.\\
\\
Streaming component is responsible for streaming multimedia content to selected
multimedia receivers, such as TVs, wireless speakers, set top boxes etc. In our
solution, since DLNA, AirPlay video/ photo and Chromecast all use HTTP streaming
while AirPlay music uses RTSP. Two types of media servers are built inside our
application. A RAOP server handles the AirPlay music streaming, a HTTP server
handles all the streaming else.

\subsection{Implementation}
The target platform is Android, Android APIs provide many useful interfaces and
give permissions like accessing Internet, accessing WiFi state change, allowing
WiFi multicast, reading phone storage etc. The programming language used is
Java, while some transcoding work is dependent on some pre-compiled native C
libraries.\\
\\
Since Apple has not provided its official specification of AirPlay, the
implementation is mostly written following unofficial guidelines. However, Apple
provide its official mDNS implementation, this piece of code is reused and
compiled as a shared native library. Remote Audio Output Protocol(RAOP) is
implemented as a UDP server and TCP control channel, working together following
the unofficial specification.\\
\\
DLNA has open specification for its members. Tuxera is a member of DLNA so we
got detailed specification and test tools. There is also an open source UPnP/DLNA
library called "cling"\cite{cling}, it has basic minimal implementation of UPnP
device discovery, description information parsing, and basic message handling.
Thus we mostly develop DLNA support on top of the cling library.\\
\\
Google provide Chromecast SDK for different mobile platforms, so integration
with Chromecast became easy. In streambels project, the Chromecast integration
is built upon Chromecast API.\\
\\
In order to serve media for all the receivers, two types of serve method need to
be implemented in a HTTP server. According to the DLNA guideline, certain
additional headers need to be implemented in the stream, which requires the HTTP
server to be flexible to add DLNA specific headers.  Byte based seeking
operation should also be implemented to enable "seek" action on the receiver
side.\\
\\
For receivers other than DLNA, a basic file server with byte range support will
be sufficient to do the work. After comparing multiple server implementations
on Android, NanoHTTPD is the perfect library for our need, it is easy to use,
Apache licensed, very tiny and efficient implementation, since it is minimal
implemented, so it is also easy to be modified and add additional headers to be
compatible with DLNA receivers.
\\
A simplified version of our implementation is shown in the figure \ref{chart3}
below:

\caption{Simplified flow chart \label{chart3}}
\end{figure}

In terms of data flow, as described in figure \ref{chart4}, there are three
different types of data flow models:\\
\\ 
If the streamed content is stored in mobile phone, a streaming server in the
application is used to stream the content from phone to selected receiver.\\
\\
Otherwise, if the content locates on the Internet, and the receiver is a DLNA
Media Renderer, a proxy is needed to firstly download the resource stream, add
the required headers by DLNA protocols and then stream the content to selected
DLNA Media Renderer.\\
\\
Finally, if the streamed content locates in a DLNA Digital Media Server, the
source can be directly used by all receivers, in this case, the content
streaming happened directly from media server to receivers, application is only
used as a control point and do not participate in the media transmission.\\

\end{figure}

\subsection{UX design}
In terms of UI and UX, the application should be simple enough to be used by
everyone, it shouldn't be difficult for people to locate the media, browse
content on different sources, and follow the data flow between devices. The
control of devices should also be intuitive so that inter operation with
each other goes seamlessly.\\
\\
Our designer Hien did a great job of defining a simple and intuitive user
interface \ref{chart5}, which benefits a lot for the user experience.\\
\\
A multimedia home networking solution should be content centric, so the
application actually looks like a multimedia player, a cast button is added in
order to select cast devices. The content is categorized into 4 sections: music,
video, photo and online sources. In Android, since the system provides share
intent method for inter activity communication, an interface is also made to
manage share intents from other activities. In every place in the application,
selected receiver is visible to user and users can navigate and switching
between different devices.\\

\subsection{Features}
As described previously that AirPlay, DLNA and other standards work
differently and have different features, but according to the previous study,
we could combine some common use cases of both protocols.\\
\\
The Android application we developed can handle most multimedia devices in 
a typical home networking. It has various features that make it a useful and
universal solution for multimedia home networking.\\
\\
Firstly, the app itself is a multimedia playing, all media stored locally on the
phone storage and all media located in the home DLNA media servers can be
browsed and played on the phone.\\
\\
Secondly, the app is fully compatible with AirPlay, DLNA, Chromecast and FireTV
receiver devices.\\
\\ 
Thirdly and most importantly, the application make the DLNA media server works
together with all kind of receivers regardless of protocol used. The app served
as a bridge of different multimedia receivers and media sources.\\
\\
Last, YouTube and other on-line channels like Vimeo and Facebook are supported
as media source, and can be streamed regardless of protocol to all supported
receivers that are connected to home network.\\
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item[--]Firstly the app is a multimedia player, it can play music, photos and videos 
on SD card locally on Android phone
\item[--]It can stream local content to Apple TV, Airport express and AirPlay-enabled 
speakers.
\item[--]It can stream local content to DLNA media renderers, which has a huge device 
base.
\item[--]It can stream local content to Chromecast devices.
\item[--]It can browse content from the DLNA media servers, a typical source is a 
Network Attached Storage (NAS). And play the media locally on the Android device.
\item[--]It can browse content from the DLNA media servers and stream it to DLNA media 
renderers.
\item[--]It can browse content from DLNA media servers and stream it to AirPlay enabled 
devices using a different protocol.
\item[--]It can proxy online channels' content to DLNA and AirPlay enabled devices. 
(Currently YouTube and Facebook videos are supported, but integration to Spotify is still 
in progress).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extensibility}
In normal use cases, the data flow can be shown as figure \ref{chart4},
Streambels has embedded a media streaming server for local files and streaming
proxy for bridging the gap between online resources and home networking. By
using built-in proxy, Streambels is able to share on-line resources from
Internet to devices in home networking environment. New services and new
content providers can be easily added by just call the proxy interface.\\
\\
The proxy system enables a huge extensibility possibility, which connects the
home networking and Internet or Cloud Services.\\
\\
Further development abstracted all the protocols and developed an API for all
content holders or cloud services to integrate their service.

\subsection{Test methodology}
Software testing is quite important for a modern IT project. Through testing we
can assure performance and stability, before releasing the app to App store, we
conduct a series of tests.\\
\\
These tests include unit test, integration test and functional test.
Unit tests is written while coding, when each class is finished, unit tests will
be written for each method, we set up an continuous integration server so that
each time when we commit something to the git repository, a full unit tests will
be run and if there were some failure in the unit tests, developer will be
informed. Integration is done in a way that we ensure each function module
should work together with other modules in the system. Last, we listed all the
possible use cases, prepared a huge media base which contains all kind of media
files, we do manual test before the app is finally released in the market.

\subsection{Evaluation methodology}
Experimental setup\\
\\
Since the project is targeted to Android market, and is directly used by
end users, feedback is really important to us for the continuous development. We
used Email for normal communication, user can edit feedback content directly
inside the application, and later content is sent to us by email.\\
\\
There is no perfect application, so crash sometimes happen, thanks to Google,
the Google will help to collect the crash reports and show it inside developer
console.\\
\\
Inside Streambels, we also used Google's Analytics API, which give us
great convenience to collect number of users and sessions every day. Other
information like operation system version, application version, active users
helped us to have insights into who are our users and how can we market for more
people in the world.\\
\\
It is also interesting to see what kind of technologies are most used in their
daily life, thanks to Google's analytics SDK, we can trigger events when user
selected their receivers, so after months of statistics, we can figure out the
most popular standards and most popular online channels that user uses, and in
turn make better optimizations for users need.
