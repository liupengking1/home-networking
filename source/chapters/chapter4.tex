After designing, implementing and testing the software. We started several
evaluation tests on the streaming performance, and we have released the
application to public in Nov 2013. So far, we have improved the application a
lot and also brought many new features to it. As discussed in previous chapter,
we used Google Analytics SDK to help us get insights to our application and our
users. In this chapter we will present and analyze those results.

\subsection{Performance}
In terms of streaming, our solution include two major streaming components. It
would be interesting to study how the media streaming protocol have the better 
performance while streaming multimedia contents. And also, by comparing
different streaming types of media, we could investigate which protocol is best
suitable for certain type of media. Two major streaming technology we
used in our solution are HTTP streaming and RTSP streaming.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) refers to the protocol used to deliver web
pages and images across the Internet worldwide. HTTP is an adopted, open
standard-the most ubiquitous mode of delivery on-line. HTTP is a "stateless"
protocol; think of it as an airline ticket to anywhere. HTTP can be delivered
by a variety of web servers, both commercial and open source.

Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol used in
entertainment and communications systems to control streaming media servers.

RTSP is used to establish and control media sessions between two points,
usually server and player client. Clients of media servers issue VCR-like
commands, such as PLAY and PAUSE, to facilitate real-time control of playback
of media files from the server. Microsoft's Smooth Streaming is a hybrid
delivery method that acts like traditional RTSP streaming but is based on HTTP
PDL. Apple Â®'s HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is another example of using HTTP to
deliver video with new techniques.

AirPlay uses RTSP streaming for the iTunes music.
