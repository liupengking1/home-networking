 This paper analysis the solutions to home multimedia network, compare 
 nowadays-popular home networking solutions, especially for the DLNA 
 (Digital Living Network Alliance) standard. By comparing different 
 features and implementations, our team developed a suitable mobile 
 solution for multimedia home networking which takes advantage of both 
 Airplay and DLNA protocols on Android platform.

 It started with a comparison of popular streaming technologies, Airplay, 
 DLNA, Miracast and Chromecast. By analyzing the features and capabilities 
 of those streaming technologies, we proposed a universal solution for 
 multimedia home networking by supporting multiple protocols.

 In the middle of the paper, I tested different multimedia solutions and 
 implement an online channel proxy for our app "Streambels" to stream online 
 channels like YouTube and Spotify and finally get a published Android 
 application for Tuxera Inc. The application is already published in Google 
 Play Store for 3 months, which generate a statistic report of how users use 
 our app, so there is a short description of the user behavior, and how we 
 could improve user experience by analyzing these data.

 At the end of the paper there is a discussion on the future of Home 
 network and DLNA.
