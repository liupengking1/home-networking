<p>This is the topic of my master's thesis at Aalto University. It takes me over two years to 
finish it, since I am at the same time working in Tuxera full time. This repository is private, but you can download the latest version of my draft thesis. I aim to submit it on 20th May 2015.</p>

<p>This document is my master's thesis of Communications Engineering majoring in
Networking at Aalto University. All research and development of this thesis was
conducted at Tuxera Inc. in Helsinki from January 2013 to June 2014. Tuxera is a
high-tech startup that develops kernel-level file systems and multimedia solutions
for leading software, hardware and electronics companies.</p>

<p>During this project I worked together with my colleagues at Tuxera, I started
to work on DLNA project for the first few months during which period I learned
DLNA architecture and made a research about Digital Media Server solutions.
After that I worked on an Android project to develop a universal solution for
multimedia home networking.</p>

<a id="acknowledgements" class="anchor" href="#acknowledgements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>First of all, I would like to thank the Streambels team at Tuxera, whom I worked
together throughout the project. I would like to thank Karthik Ramakrishna, our
lead developer. Every week he helped solving problems in the project,
no matter the question was theoretical or technical, he always answered my
questions. As our project manager, Oscar Santolalla helped us with
organizational problems we encountered and taught us to look at things from a
end user perspective as well. Sakari Tanskanen, our mobile developer helped us
by integrating Chromecast and FireTV support to Stremabels. Nadir Javed, our
quality assurance engineer helped us with the quality management and testing of
potential bugs before releasing the product to end users. Karolina Mosiadz, our
Public Relations Manager helped to listen to user's feedback every day and provide the unique
insights in improving Streambels. Hien Le, our UX designer helped us to develop
a very handy user interface. And special thanks to Mikko Valimaki and Szabolcs
Szakacsits who lead the company and gave me the opportunity to participate in
this great project. Without them, I would not have been able to finish this
report.</p>

<p>I thank my university supervisor Raimo Kantola, who helped me to develop a good
thesis topic based on my project and helped me with initial problem description.
I got great support from him with his critique and useful advice, especially
during the middle and final period, when I wrote the report.</p>

<p>Finally, I thank everybody who supported me during my graduation work,
especially my family, friends and house-mates.</p>
